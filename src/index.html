                    </div>

                <div class=container-intro>
                    <div class=intro><p>Iconic is an loose word to throw around in music‚Äîespecially live music, for that matter‚Äîbut it‚Äôs fair to say that the United Kingdom‚Äôs Reading Festival lives up to the word. The oldest popular music festival in history, it evolved from jazz roots in the 1960s to become the modern rock n‚Äô roll powerhouse it is today. From Kurt Cobain‚Äôs wheelchair stunt to the Arctic Monkeys‚Äô humble beginnings, the festival has played a quintessential role in many of the biggest rock acts over the years while maintaining its mantra as a ‚Äúfans‚Äô festival,‚Äù according to the BBC.</br>
                    </br>
                    Reading Festival is now colloquially known as Reading and Leeds, a name-change prompted by the three-day event expanding to two locations in 1999 (Leeds is in North England, Reading is in South England). Since then, Reading and Leeds has cemented itself as a stronghold in the broad but recognizable indie, alternative, and rock genre.</br>
                    </br>
                    As Frith, Brennan, Cloonan, and Webster stated in 2013, ‚Äú...most present accounts of ‚Äòthe music industry‚Äô over-privilege the recording sector at the expense of the sector in which most musicians in all genres have been located historically: the live arena.‚Äù With that said, the goal is to use Reading and Leeds Festival poster placement as an illustration of musicians' career arcs.</br>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>Like Catfish and the Bottlemen, different acts have different arcs throughout their time at the Festival.</br>
                </br>    
                In order to conceptualize that, we need understand the set-up of Reading and Leeds posters. Over the past twenty years, <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">the layout of the Festival itself and the accompanying posters has stayed overwhelmingly similar</span>.</p></div>
            <div class=collage><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>To understand what the poster is saying, think of it like a spreadsheet: The <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">columns represent each day</span> of the Festival, and the <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">rows below are the acts</span>, in ranked order.</p></div>
            <div class=diagram><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>The red boxes in the diagram above represent each day of the lineup that year. The lineup is also broken up by performance stages, as seen in the black boxes on the diagram. All the components of the poster follow the same rule: <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">higher up holds greater prominence and physical size</span> while <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">lower is reserved for smaller, emerging acts</span>.</br>
            </br>
            The within-stage hierarchy is the same‚Äîhowever, it sometimes can get a bit blurry. For example, acts are often placed on the same level, and therefore the same rank.</p></div>
            <div class=example><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>Let‚Äôs choose to look at the posters on the stage level, with the underlying assumption that leveling up between stages is a clear inflection point in a musician‚Äôs arc. The stages in the past 20 years have stayed as similar as the style of the poster‚Äîbesides name and sponsorship changes, each have held a similar place in the lineup.</br>
            </br>
            At the bottom of the lineup is the <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">BBC Music Introducing stage</span>, which highlights the smallest‚Äîbut exciting‚Äîacts. Above that is the <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">Festival Republic stage</span> (formerly the Carling Stage), a place for slightly larger, but still up-and-coming acts. You can trace the beginning of the some of the biggest bands in the world to this stage‚Äîif they were starting to gain notoriety in the past twenty years and played Reading and Leeds, there's a good chance they started on this stage. Next are one or two genre-based stages: <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">A dance stage and a hard rock/punk stage</span>. Second to top is the <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">NME/BBC Radio 1 Stage</span> while the <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">main stage</span> is No. 1 in the ranking.</br>
            </br>
            Because of this consistency, we can judge an artist‚Äôs lineup placement based on the stage they‚Äôre playing. In order to analyze at a larger scale, we can templatize a poster in the following manner, with higher opacity correlating to a higher place in the ranking.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=template><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-row >
                <div class=bars><svg width=600 height=500 id="chart-1"></svg></div>
                <div class=text-right><p>Let‚Äôs first look at how many times every act that has been on a lineup in the past twenty years has played the Festival in total. This corpus includes <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">over 2,400 unique artists</span>.</p></div>
                <script src=bar-1.js></script>
            </div>
    
            <div class=container-body-row >

                <div class=text-right><p>But that includes <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">over 2,250 artists that have only played once, twice, or three times in the past twenty years</span>‚Äîblips on the lineup, if you will. To make sure we have enough inflection points to create a healthy path, we're keep analyzing acts who played the Festival more than four times in the past 20 years. This leaves us with a corpus of <span style="background:#931F1D;color:#F9F9F9">128 artists</span> to analyze.</br>
                </br>Hover over each bar to see the artists it contains.</p></div>
                <script src=bar-2.js></script>
            </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>Let‚Äôs peer inside one of the bars on the histogram and look how this ranking flows through the posters.</br>
                    </br>
                    Biffy Clyro has played Reading and Leeds Festival eight times in the past 20 years. Their stage placement on the lineup stumbled around the middle for a while (in 2002, they played on the Carling Stage, a.k.a. the Festival Republic stage) until reaching the top and staying there. Since 2008, if Biffy Clyro were on the lineup, they were headlining.</br> 
                    </br>
                    We can visually explore that on the posters themselves.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=biffy><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
            <div class=middle><p>And if we remove the posters and just look at the line...</p></div>
            <div class=biffy-line><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
            <div class=middle><p>Reviewing this spread, clear types of arcs emerge. Let's dive into three using case studies.</p></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
                <div class=middle><p>PATTERN #1: Steady Rise Arc</br>
                The 1975 are a prime example of the <strong>"success story"</strong> arc. They started on the Festival Republic stage during their first appearance, and progressively got higher in the ranking until they hit headlining status.</p></div>
                <div class=case-study-1975><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
                <div class=middle><p>PATTERN #2: Quick Rise Arc</br>
                Arctic Monkeys are a prime example of the <strong>"exponential rise"</strong> arc. They started on the Festival Republic stage in 2005, and then immediately shot to headling status the following year, where they've stayed ever since. It's interesting to think about their arc in terms of the "success story" arc of the 1975, extrapolating if the 1975 will stay at the top after their more progressive rise.</div>
                <div class=case-study-arctic><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>
        </div>

        <div class=container-body-column>
                <div class=middle><p>PATTERN #3: Comeback Arc</br>
                The Wombats are a prime example of the <strong>"comeback"</strong> arc. They started strong in 2008, but dropped three stage rankings in 2015. However, by the next year, they bounced back up to the top.<p></div>
                    <div class=case-study-wombats><img height=100px src="img/1999.jpg"></img></div>

        <div class=container-conclusion>
            <div class=conclusion><p>By using 20 years of Reading and Leeds Festival posters as our database, we were able to construct musician career arcs using their yearly stage rankings. Reading Festival is the oldest music festival in the world, and in 1999, it expanded to two locations, now occuring in Reading and Leeds over the same Bank Holiday weekend every year. There's a certain prestige in headlining this "fan's festival," a status not included in traditional forms of analysis in the music industry, such as record sales and streams.</br>
            </br>We first investigated how many times each artist on the lineup in the past 20 years played the festival in total. We found a large number of one(-and two, and three) hit wonders.</br>
        </br>We then defined a way to analyze this specific set of posters, which have a layout that has stayed overwhelmingly consistent over the past two decades. The resulting stage ranking analysis provided adequate inflection points for artists who played the festival four or more times, allowing us to programmatically create a path‚Äîa.k.a. career arc‚Äîfor each.</br>
    </br>Looking at the spread of career arcs, there weren't any recognizable pattern when grouped by number of times played or year of first appearance. However, there were patterns in types of career arcs: We took a closer look at the "success story," "exponential rise," and "comeback" arcs.</p></div>
